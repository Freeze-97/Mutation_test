# 🧑‍🔬 Mutation Test
This project demonstrates mutation testing using unit tests in Java. The goal of mutation testing is to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing small changes (mutants) into the code and verifying whether the tests can detect them.

## 📌 Project Structure
The project includes two classes under test:

- BowlingGame.java – A class that calculates the score of a ten-pin bowling game.

- StoreInventoryManager.java – A class for managing a store’s inventory.

And corresponding test classes:

- BowlingGameTest.java – A comprehensive set of unit tests to validate the scoring logic for different bowling scenarios.

- StoreInventoryManagerTest.java – Tests for inventory operations (CRUD, quantity checks, etc.).

## 🔧 How to Run the Tests
Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

Ensure you have JUnit 5 set up in your classpath.

Run the tests via your IDE or a build tool like Maven/Gradle (if applicable).
